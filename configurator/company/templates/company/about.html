            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are two students from the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, currently in our third semester of the <em><a href="https://www.tha.de/Architektur-und-Bauwesen/Digitaler-Baumeister-Bachelor.html" target="_blank" class="text-reset">Digitaler Baumeister </a></em>. This project is part of our coursework for the Computer Science module and the P2 project module, where we are combining creativity and technical skills to develop innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>The Flexi Collection, a product line that seamlessly combines innovation, design, and functionality. The collection features two key products: the Flexi Box and the Flexi Table, both of which we have designed and created ourselves. From the initial sketches to the final models, every detail of the Flexi Box and the Flexi Table was thoughtfully crafted by us. We conducted extensive research on ergonomics and seating behavior to ensure that these products not only look great but also promote comfort and well-being in everyday use.</p>
            <p>Viktoriia Oksymets and Viktoria Krebs have collaborated under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Tobias Maile to create a vision that emphasizes the power of customization. We are dedicated to turning this vision into reality and bringing innovative solutions to life.</p>
            <p>To complement the Flexi Collection, we are developing this digital platform designed to enhance your experience. The website will feature interactive product displays, customization options to tailor your Flexi products to your needs, and an intuitive shopping experience. Join us as we transform the way you interact with versatile, sustainable, and smart furniture.</p>
