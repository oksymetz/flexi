            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a team of students from the Technische Hochschule Augsburg, currently working on an innovative project that combines elements from both computer science and project management. The project is part of the P2 Projectmodul course, which is integrated with the D5 Computer Science course.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to design an ergonomic desk that is affordable to produce, made from various materials, and customizable to meet the individual needs of its user. By incorporating elements of both engineering and technology, we aim to create a product that addresses the modern need for both functionality and personalization in furniture design.</p>
            <p>This project is a collaboration between Viktoriia Oksymets and Viktoria Krebs, supervised by Prof. Dr. Tobias Maile. We believe in the power of customization and are excited to bring this vision to life.</p>
